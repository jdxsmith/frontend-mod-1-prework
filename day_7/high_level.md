## High Level Notes

### Ceaser Cipher

1. In order to solve this problem, I must first understand exactly what I'm trying to do.  My first step would be to read the prompt several times to gain an understanding of the problem and the information I've been given.

2. Once I understand the problem, my next step would be to open up a JavaScript file and go ahead and plug in the code that I've been given, or the code I know I'll need. For this problem, I'm given a snippet of code that tells me a few things; it tells me I need to create a class called `CeasarCipher` and give it a method named `encode`.  I now have a basic understanding of the code that I need to create.

3. Now that I've expended my current knowledge of JavaScript for this specific problem, my next step is to go to Google.  Sites like stack-overflow and MDN for JavaScript are very helpful for finding information about problems that I don't fully understand by myself.  If I google 'Ceasar Cipher javascript', I can look through some results and find information on the problem and potentially some examples of code that has worked for other people.

4. After I've found some information and examples on Google, I can begin to apply it to my own code.  This begins a process of trial and error.  Since I'm still fairly new to JavaScript, it will probably be a long process of errors and trying out different bits of code in order to build something that works. The most important part of this process is understanding what I'm building.  I want to make something that works, but I also want to know WHY it works.  If I simply copy something and have no clue what it's doing, I haven't really learned anything.
