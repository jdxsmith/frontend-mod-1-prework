## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a function?
* The purpose of a function is to make it easier to perform certain tasks without having to rewrite new code every time you have to use this task.  You can create the function once, and then call upon that function every time you want it to run.

2. What is a parameter? 
* A parameter is a piece of information that a function needs to be given in order to run.

3. What is a return value?
* A return value is the output that a function may give you after it's run.  For example, if a function is being used to add two numbers, the return value would be the sum of those numbers.

4. In the space below, declare a function named `hello` that will print to the console, `"Sam I am"`.
* `function hello() {
    console.log("Sam I am");
}`

5. Declare a function name `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and logs `name + " I am"`.
* `function hello_someone() {
    var name = Bill;
    console.log(name + " I am");
}`

6. How would you _call_ or _execute_ the function that you created above?
* By typing `hello_someone();`.

7. What questions do you still have about functions in JavaScript?
* I'm still slightly confused as to what exactly an 'argument' is.  I think I have a good understanding, but I'm not 100% sure.
