## Day 5 Questions

1. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?
* An object holds attributes of different data types as well as methods, while an array just holds multiples of one data type.

2. In the space below, create an Object stored to a variable named `petStore`.  This Object should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.
* `var petStore = {
    dogCages: 28,
    birdHouses: 31,
    goldfish: 73,
};`

3. Given the following `states = {"CO": "Colorado", "IA": "Iowa", "OK": "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`?
* `states.IA;`

4. How would you add a new property to that Object with a key of `"MN"` and a value of `"Minnesota"`?
* `states.MN = "Minnesota";`

5. What is another example of when we might use a Object?  In this case, why is an Object better than an Array?
* If you want to assign both a name and a number of spots to a dog, you can create an object named 'dog' and assign it a string for its name and an integer for its number of spots.  An object can be used when you want to assign different types of data to a variable (or object).

6. What questions do you still have about Objects?
* My only question would be how methods can work within objects.  I understand the example on the main day_5 page, but I'm curious about more practical examples.  As of right now, I feel that I have a good understanding of objects.
