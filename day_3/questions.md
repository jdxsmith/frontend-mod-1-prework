## Day 3 Questions

1. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.
* A conditional statement is a statement where a condition must be met in order for something else to happen.  For example, *if* I don't get out of bed in the morning, *then* I can't make pancakes.  In a web application, *if* you click on a link, *then* you are taken to another page.

2. Why might you want to use an `if` statement?
* You can use if statements to return a message or action based on the value of the user's input.

3. What is the JavaScript syntax for an `if` statement?
* if (condition) {
    console.log("result");
} 

4. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement?
* The `&&` operator is used to add multiple conditions to an if statement.

5. What is the JavaScript syntax for an `if/else` statement?
* if (condition) {
    console.log("result");
} else {
    console.log("different result");
}

6. Other than an `if` statement, can you think of any other ways we might want to use a conditional statement?
* A `when` statement is something that could be used.  For example, *when* the timer hits zero, display a message.  I guess this could just be done with an if statement, but I'm not sure how it would work in certain cases.
