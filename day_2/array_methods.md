## Array Methods

1. *Pop* - The `pop()` method takes the last element in an array and removes it.  If you use the `pop()` method to print to the console, it will return the current last element in the array and remove it from the array.

1. *Push* - the `push()` method adds elements to the end of an array.  This alters both the contents and length of the chosen array.

1. *Shift* - The `shift()` method removes the first element of an array.  It works similar to the `pop()` method, but with the first element instead of the last.

1. *Unshift* - the `unshift()` method adds elements to the beginning of an array.  This is similar to the `push()` method, except adds to the beginning of an array.
